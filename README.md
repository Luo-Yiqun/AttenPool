# AttenPool

This is the implementation of AttenPool, a novel aggregation method for Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for CMU 11785 Fall 2024 Final Project.

There are only 10 structures under PoolingMEGNet for debug purposes.
The whole datasets are too large to be uploaded to GitHub.
To generate the entire input datasets, one may refer to their original papers and use ```QM9_to_pt.py``` and/or ```OE62_to_pt.py```.

To run the example code, one may change directory to ```PoolingMEGNet``` and run ```python main.py```.
